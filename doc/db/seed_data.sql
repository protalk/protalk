However, just getting unit tests in on a real, commercial project is hard - switching to TDD is even harder. Often you can start a project with good intentions and coverage, then the deadline looms and the tests go out then the hacks come in. So, instead of beating ourselves up about not being perfect let\'s look at an interative approach to adopting TDD principles. We\'ll look at tactics for selling TDD to your client, boss and colleagues. This talk will also cover methods for making TDD easier for you by showing you what tools you can use to integrate it into your development environment. In the project itself, we\'ll examine how we can make small but permanent steps towards full TDD, without losing that progress when deadlines hit. We\'ll also cover a few methods for learning on your own time and how the whole process can actually be made quite enjoyable.','51:50',0,131,'http://dpcradio.s3.amazonaws.com/2011_017.mp3','<div style=\"width:425px\" id=\"__ss_7510674\"> <strong style=\"display:block;margin:12px 0 4px\"><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/rowan_m/tdd-and-getting-paid\" title=\"TDD and Getting Paid\" target=\"_blank\">TDD and Getting Paid</a></strong> <iframe src=\"http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/7510674\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <div style=\"padding:5px 0 12px\"> View more <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/\" target=\"_blank\">presentations</a> from <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/rowan_m\" target=\"_blank\">Rowan Merewood</a> </div> </div>',3218,'en','TDD and getting paid','tdd-and-getting-paid',0,'DPCRadio','http://techportal.inviqa.com/2012/04/10/dpc-radio-tdd-and-getting-paid/',NULL,'2012-06-07','pub'),(7,4,'2011-05-20','Even bad code can function.

In effect, APIs are the ugly stepchild of the Web.\n\nThis is a sad reality that we are faced with, because many companies make their living consuming third-party APIs and mixing in their own data to create amazing and interesting mashups. In the initial phases of development, there is rarely enough money to develop the app and its API. By the time there’s both demand and money, it can be hard to fit an API on top of the architecture in such a way that the whole thing won\'t fall over. APIs should be first class citizens of the Web. Inconceivable? Possimpible? Not at all!\n\nIn this talk we will dive deeper into why APIs are an afterthought, how we can change that.

Some of them have worked as PHP developers, others have some exposure to JSP or .NET, the remainder have C, Java or VB experience, according to their course.To this end I have implemented a series of exemplars covering different aspects of the paradigm, which have slowly coalesced into a proto-framework focussed on promoting good practice, at the same time being flexible enough to allow students to develop their own ideas.

All resources for all modules were initialized on each request, and bootstrapping modules was an onerous task. Due to the difficulties, modules were never truly \"plug-and-play\", and thus no ecosystem ever evolved for sharing modules.\r\n\r\nIn Zend Framework 2, we\'ve architected the MVC from the ground up to make modular applications as easy as possible. Within ZF2, the MVC simply cares about events and services — and controllers are simply one kind of service. As such, modules are primarily about telling the MVC about services and wiring event listeners.\r\n\r\nTo give you an example, in this tutorial, I\'ll show you how to install the Zend Framework 2 skeleton application, and we\'ll then install a module and see how easy it is to add it to the application and then configure it.','09:10',0,789,'<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/49775540\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>',NULL,NULL,'en','ZF2 Modules Quickstart (Screencast)','zf2-modules-quickstart-screencast',0,'phly, boy, phly: matthew weier o\'phinney','http://mwop.net/blog/2012-09-19-zf2-module-screencast.html',NULL,'2012-09-25','pub'),(44,1,'2012-09-06','Atlanta PHP User Group presentation','52:38',0,266,'<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/49466234?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;autoplay=1\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>',NULL,NULL,'en','Technical Debt','technical-debt',0,'Atlanta PHP User Group','http://atlantaphp.org/video/','http://atlantaphp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Technical_Debt.jpg','2012-09-27','pub'),(45,1,'2012-06-07','Atlanta PHP User Group presentation','39:13',0,127,'<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/45417023?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;autoplay=1\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>',NULL,NULL,'en','Intro to the Laravel PHP Framework','intro-to-the-laravel-php-framework',0,'Atlanta PHP User Group','http://atlantaphp.org/video/','http://atlantaphp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/laravel_thumbnail.jpg','2012-09-27','pub'),(46,1,'2012-05-03',NULL,'55:45',0,135,'<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/42722025?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;autoplay=1\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>',NULL,NULL,'en','PyroCMS!','pyrocms',0,'Atlanta PHP User Group','http://atlantaphp.org/video','http://atlantaphp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/pyrocms_thumbnail.jpg','2012-09-27','pub'),(47,1,'2012-07-04','In this, the first episode of PHP Cloud Development Casts, we go through how to get started deploying to the cloudControl (cloudControl.com) platform.

This process is described in the book Domain-Driven Design (Addison-Wesley 2004) written by Eric Evans. Domain-driven design starts with the assertion that (for almost all software) complexity is in the domain, not in the technology. Accordingly, we must let technology play a supporting role. Domain-driven design attempts to focus on and distill the core domain for a given project. Philosopher and scientist Alfred Korzybski said, \"The map is not the territory.\" As such, a person practicing domain-driven design does not attempt to model reality. Instead, domain experts and software practitioners use a mental model as a tool for solving problems within a given domain. The domain experts and software practitioners collaborate to explore and develop this model. No software of any reasonable scope has just one model. We will look at the concept of a bounded context within which each model can be isolated and explored. Within a bounded context, collaborators must speak a ubiquitous language in order to reason about and discuss the model. We will also talk about domain-driven design\'s building block patterns including entities, value objects, aggregates, repositories, services, and domain events. We will look at domain-driven design practices including supple design, strategic design, and distillation of the core. We will see how test-driven development can be used as a means of exploring the model. Examples in PHP will be provided of the building block patterns as well as other techniques including closure of operations, intention revealing interfaces, side-effect free functions, and assertions.','1:05:37',0,78,'<iframe width=\"475\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/RNUn2R7TptM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>','<script async class=\"speakerdeck-embed\" data-id=\"508850b1db554a000206fc69\" data-ratio=\"1.33333333333333\" src=\"//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js\"></script>',NULL,'en','Domain-Driven Design','domain-driven-design',0,'ZendTechnologies YouTube Channel','http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNUn2R7TptM&feature=plcp','http://img.youtube.com/vi/RNUn2R7TptM/default.jpg','2012-12-04','pub'),(109,2,'2012-10-23','MySQL users commonly ask: Here\'s my table, what indexes do I need?

Once you have multiple PHP processes running you will probably want to make them talk to each other. We will look at the various techniques for inter process communication. Finally we will look at what turns out to be the hardest part of parallel scripts namely thinking about your problems in a parallel way. I will try and offer some tips on how to start doing this and go about getting more work done at the same time.','00:43:38',0,25,'<iframe src=\"http://blip.tv/play/h75rg4qiGgI.html?p=1\" width=\"532\" height=\"334\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http://a.blip.tv/api.swf#h75rg4qiGgI\" style=\"display:none\"></embed>','<script async class=\"speakerdeck-embed\" data-id=\"5071626260c4040002051575\" data-ratio=\"1.2994923857868\" src=\"//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js\"></script>',NULL,'en','Fork It!

The advent of the micro-computer (e.g. the ubiquitous Raspberry PI) has meant that we\'re now back to a constrained environment. To paraphrase a famous misquote; \"256MB RAM ought to be enough for anybody\". This talk is about getting the overhead of your web stack down. For database and web services and the PHP binaries themselves, we\'ll discuss the process of finding lightweight replacements for PHP\'s usual entourage. Once the stack is trimmed down, we then need to refocus on our choice of frameworks and even approaches to writing memory and CPU efficient applications. Being sensitive to resource consumption shouldn\'t be a novelty. While no-one wants to advocate premature optimisation, if you know what you can squeeze out of PHP\'s stack in a memory constrained environment, you should be able to take those principles when approaching a problem more conventional hardware.','00:33:54',0,22,'<iframe src=\"http://blip.tv/play/h75rg4qOBgI.html?p=1\" width=\"532\" height=\"334\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http://a.blip.tv/api.swf#h75rg4qOBgI\" style=\"display:none\"></embed>',NULL,NULL,'en','Put LAMP on a Diet','put-lamp-on-a-diet',1,'PHPNW videos','http://blip.tv/phpnw/phpnw12-adrian-hardy-put-lamp-on-a-diet-6456994','http://a.images.blip.tv/Phpcodemonkey-PHPNW12AdrianHardyPutLAMPOnADiet240-74.jpg','2013-02-14','pub'),(176,2,'2012-10-06','One framework to rule them all!

By centralising this content at the Model and database level, extending upon a core set of tables for more diverse content types we can save development time by sharing functionality to all content types. User features such as commenting, rating, viewing content as an RSS feed, and administrative functionality, such as CRUD functions, deactivating content, rolling back versions, and moving content within a site or menu hierarchy can be applied to all of the content types. This approach is similar to how content works in Drupal, with all content stemming from a &#8220;node&#8221;. By combining this with a simple MVC architecture, new content types can easily be dropped in, with models inheriting from a parent content type which holds the data common to all content types, and controllers inheriting from a parent content controller, which centralises hierarchies of content of each type, and CRUD functions.Through real examples, this talk would show developers how to save development time, increase efficiency, and reduce testing time by showing how content can be centralised, and functionality can be abstracted so that it can easily apply to any type of content, without any additional work. This would mean an e-commerce site with product ratings, could add ratings to pages, blog entries and other content, without any extra development work.This is the perfect complement to any MVC based development framework, making code even easier and quicker to extend. Since introducing this approach to our own frameworks, productivity has increased dramatically, and as new content types are added, only a few lines of new code need to be added to get the full set of CRUD functions.Associated Slides','00:28:21',0,0,'<iframe src=\"http://blip.tv/play/h75rgpKTNwI.html?p=1\" width=\"532\" height=\"334\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http://a.blip.tv/api.swf#h75rgpKTNwI\" style=\"display:none\"></embed>',NULL,NULL,'en','PHPNW10: Michael Peacock: Abstracting Functionality with centralised content','phpnw10-michael-peacock-abstracting-functionality-with-centralised-content',1,'PHPNW videos','http://blip.tv/phpnw/phpnw10-michael-peacock-abstracting-functionality-with-centralised-content-4491603','http://a.images.blip.tv/Phpcodemonkey-PHPNW10MichaelPeacockAbstractingFunctionalityWithCentralis145-679.jpg','2013-02-14','pend'),(202,2,'2010-12-03','We&#8217;ve all read the textbooks and are using version control systems for our code, but our databases are left out in the cold.

You need to find the options that aid your productivity, rather than restrict you with unnecessary overhead. Plusnet has been running its business on PHP for over a decade now, and over that time we&#8217;ve used a mixture of home-grown tools and off-the-shelf solutions. Some of these have stuck, some have had teething troubles, and others just haven&#8217;t caught on at all. We&#8217;ll look at the choices we&#8217;ve made for the tools that support us throughout the development process, including version control, unit testing, debugging, quality metrics, bug tracking and, of course &#8211; actually writing code. Alongside the obvious technical merits of choosing a particular tool there are other factors to consider such as licensing, community support, industry standards, performance, security and so on.However, you can&#8217;t just throw all these tools at your developers and hope that bullet-proof code comes out the other end. You need to look at how you can trial your new choice, prove that it works, and then integrate it into your development process &#8211; and this needs to happen without just stopping your business at the same time. This might involve creating new processes to take advantage of the tools you&#8217;ve chosen, or alternatively you might be migrating from an existing tool to an improved option.All of this is purely theory without someone to champion the cause, forcing a tool from the top-down is never as effective as having your developers wanting to adopt it themselves. You need some evangelists in your organisation who can play the role of salesman, mentor, and technical expert. We&#8217;ll use a few case studies to see the experiences our developers have been through in finding a tool they wanted to use, convincing the rest of us of its value, and then how they went about getting it adopted.

Whether over technology choice, implementation options, requirements or schedule, uncertainty is normally seen as something you must either suppress or avoid. Of this many people appear, well, certain. That you should embrace it and use it to influence schedule, identify risk and inform design is not immediately obvious.

From the point of view of the application developer there are a number of choices to make, the first is whether to use a complete packaged solution or whether to use one of the available information libraries to build a custom information retrieval (IR) solution. In this talk I&#8217;ll look at the options for PHP programmers who choose to embed IR facilities within their applications.For Java programmers there is clearly a good range of options for text retrieval libraries, but options for PHP programmers are more limited. At first sight for a PHP programmer wishing to embed indexing and search facilities in their application, the choice seems obvious - the PHP implementation of Lucene (Zend Search Lucene). There is no requirement to support another language, the code is PHP therefore easy for PHP programmers to work with and the license is commercially friendly. However, whilst ease of integration and support are key factors in choice of technology, performance can also be important; the performance of the PHP implementation of Lucene is poor compared to the Java implementation.In this talk I&#8217;ll explain the differences in performance between PHP implementation of Lucene and the Java implementation and examine the other options available to PHP programmers for whom performance is a critical factor.','00:38:59',0,0,'<iframe src=\"http://blip.tv/play/h75r7o0_Ag.html?p=1\" width=\"532\" height=\"334\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http://a.blip.tv/api.swf#h75r7o0_Ag\" style=\"display:none\"></embed>',NULL,NULL,'en','PHPNW08 Track 2 Talk 3: Zoe Slattery - Index and Search, options for PHP programmers','phpnw08-track-2-talk-3-zoe-slattery-index-and-search-options-for-php-programmers',1,'PHPNW videos','http://blip.tv/phpnw/phpnw08-track-2-talk-3-zoe-slattery-index-and-search-options-for-php-programmers-1803867','http://a.images.blip.tv/Phpcodemonkey-PHPNW08Track2Talk3ZoeSlatteryIndexAndSearchOptionsFo900-176.jpg','2013-02-14','pend'),(220,2,'2009-02-20','Starting life as a community messageboard, Drupal has grown to become a powerful and flexible application open source framework for creating all types of websites.

Finally we will build a simple Zend Framework MVC application from scratch so that we can look in detail at the code.In detail, we will look at the following:What is theZend Framework?MVC and Zend FrameworkWhat is MVCAn overview of Zend Framework&#8217;s implemenation of MVC and other relevant design patterns.Building a Zend Framework applicationBootstrapping and setting upThe modelThe controlleractionsaction helpersThe viewmaster layout scriptsaction view scriptsview helpers','00:38:36',0,0,'<iframe src=\"http://blip.tv/play/h75r7fYzAg.html?p=1\" width=\"532\" height=\"334\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http://a.blip.tv/api.swf#h75r7fYzAg\" style=\"display:none\"></embed>',NULL,NULL,'en','PHPNW08 Track 1 Talk 1: Rob Allen - First Steps with Zend Framework','phpnw08-track-1-talk-1-rob-allen-first-steps-with-zend-framework',1,'PHPNW videos','http://blip.tv/phpnw/phpnw08-track-1-talk-1-rob-allen-first-steps-with-zend-framework-1800911','http://a.images.blip.tv/Phpcodemonkey-PHPNW08Track1Talk1RobAllenFirstStepsWithZendFramewor336-613.jpg','2013-02-14','pend'),(226,3,'2013-02-08','<div>\n    <div>\n          <div><div>\n  <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/styles/podcast_author_logo_detail/public/podcasts/author-logo/jam_by_schnitzel_150_4.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></div>\n</div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n    <div>\n          <div property=\"content:encoded\"><p>\n  This is part three of a conversation I had with Anthony Ferrara &ndash; PHP core contributor, security expert, and Senior Architect at <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/resources/acquia-tv/conference/nbc-universal\" title=\"NBCUniversal\" target=\"_self\">NBCUniversal</a> &ndash; at the <a href=\"http://conference.phpbenelux.eu/2013/\">PHP BeNeLux \'13</a> conference. <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/resources/podcasts/acquia-podcast-67-meet-anthony-ferrara\">In part one of our conversation</a>, we talked about open source as an ethos and how it affects business. <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/resources/podcasts/acquia-podcast-68-four-freedoms-anthony-ferrara\">In part two</a>, we talk about what the Four Freedoms mean to us as IT and web professionals, and the growing impact and influence of open source software.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Anthony Ferrara is a prominent member of the PHP community and creates many free tutorials and materials \"to help people understand complex topics in simple ways\". His blog, about PHP, security, performance and general web application development is at blog at <a href=\"http://blog.ircmaxell.com/\">http://blog.ircmaxell.com/</a> and his YouTube Channel is here: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/ircmaxell\">http://www.youtube.com/user/ircmaxell</a>.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  \"PHP is as secure as any other major language\"<br></h2>\n<p>\n  \"The first fundamental misconception about PHP is that people think PHP isn\'t secure. That is absolutely not true. PHP is as secure as any other major language. The problem with PHP is also the problem with every single other language: you can write insecure code in it,\" he underscores his point, \"but that\'s a fundamental problem in every single programming language. The job of security is not up to the language. It\'s not up to the tools that you use. It\'s up to the people that use the tools. Even the best tools can be misused and lead to major security issues.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Rails, Java, Javascript and other languages have all had vulnerabilities over the years. \"If you find a language that has not had a vulnerability of some shape or form, I\'ll show you a language that hasn\'t been used.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Developing securely<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Every single developer need to think about security when writing code. This doesn\'t mean being a security expert, but everyone should be aware of security and best development practices.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Using many of the PHP frameworks and tools that have come out in the last few years, \"It actually becomes quite easy to do security and not have to think about it.\" This can lead to its own problems, of course: \"If you depend too much on those tools, those tools become weak points.\" Anthony suggests being pro-active with your tools and I\'d add you should never trust them blindly. If you do, you lose one of the advantages of working in open source, the freedom to study and understand your code.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Fixing vulnerabilities in PHP and elsewhere<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Anthony describes how newly discovered vulnerabilities get reported and handled in so-called \"white hat\" and \"black hat\" scenarios. The \"white hat scenario\" involves someone discovering a problem and reporting it responsibly (privately) to the security team, giving them a chance to fix it before releasing the technical details of the problem.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The dangerous scenario is when a vulnerability is discovered by the security team in the aftermath of a security breach of some kind. \"You have a black hat, a \'bad guy\' who finds that vulnerability and they start using it to attack sites and we learn about it after it\'s already being used in the real world. That\'s when you can tell the difference between proactive and reactive projects: The proactive project will be able to identify it quickly, get a fix, and get it out there and then communicate the level of severity and get the problem fixed in the real world. Rails, Drupal, and PHP core do this very well.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  The security equation: everybody is part of it<br></h2>\n<p>\n  The project maintainers or security team are only half of the equation. As Anthony puts it, \"A project can fix a vulnerability within five minutes of it being reported and release a new version, but if nobody upgrades for six years, what good is it?\" It comes down to cooperation between the project security teams, \"who we trust to handle these issues appropriately and release the new versions,\" and the developers, system administrators, and users also have to \"play their part\", drop everything and fix the problem right now.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Open source gives you reason to trust<br></h2>\n<p>\n  \"I think that\'s the amazing thing about open source. There still needs to be a level of trust, but in open source, it\'s not blind trust. We trust people are going to do things the proper way, but when they do it, outside experts can also come in and look and ready and verify what has been done.\" Or they can say something still needs work, it\'s not fixed yet. \"We can work [together] to get things done better. With proprietary software, they release a fix to a security issue and you update, you think everything\'s fine, except when five days later another black hat comes along and finds another vulnerability in their fix.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  In an open source project, I can check a new security patch myself and even help to improve it if I find a problem with it. \"You hear rhetoric from time to time like, \'Well anybody can read the source code so anyone can find a security vulnerability and therefore open source is less secure.\' In reality, if that were true, that would mean security through obscurity\" ... think of an ostrich with its head in the sand ... \"is really good.\" Security through obscurity is not security at all. With open source software, you don\'t have to trust obscurity ... The beauty of it is that there are so many people out in the world who are doing it, that in practice, you tend to find that the number of critical vulnerabilities is reasonably low.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  What makes for good security?<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Anthony defines software security by how quickly a security team responds, is the response appropriate to the severity of the issue, and are the issue and fix communicated effectively.\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"All software is going to have a vulnerability the same way all software is going to have a bug. The amount of money and work it would take to produce bug-free and vulnerability-free software ... borders on infinite.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Open source projects\' issues, \"tend not to be major breaches ... For the most part, the security issues we see in Ruby on Rails, Drupal, or PHP tend to be harder [he means difficult to actually exploit in the wild] and not as critical as the public may think.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Drupal: a study in good security practices<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Anthony specifically praises the responsiveness and responsibility of the Drupal security team. Here is an infographic and article that explains how that team works in detail: <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/blog/keeping-drupal-secure\">Keeping Drupal Secure - How the world\'s largest open source CMS combines openness and security.</a> You can see Anthony\'s description of the security fix process works reflected in this.\n</p>\n<h4>Security Related Resources:</h4>\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/resources/acquia-tv/conference/three-key-steps-ensure-security-compliance-drupal-cloud-january-29\" title=\"Ensure Security Compliance with Drupal\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Webinar OnDemand:</strong> Ensure Security Compliance with Drupal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/resources/acquia-tv/conference/running-secure-drupal-websites-acquia-and-aws-july-25-2012\" title=\"Running a Secure website on Drupal\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Webinar OnDemand:</strong> Running a Secure website on Drupal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/resources/acquia-tv/conference/protect-your-drupal-site-against-xss-vulnerabilities-february-1-2012\" title=\"Protect Your Drupal Site Against XSS Vulnerabilities\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Webinar OnDemand:</strong> Protect Your Drupal Site Against XSS Vulnerabilities</a></li>\n</ul><h4>\n  Credits, thank you\'s<br></h4>\n<p>\n  Music for this podcast by <a href=\"http://soundofpicture.com/\">Podington Bear</a>.

In this part, we talk about what the Four Freedoms mean to us as IT and web professionals, but also the growing impact of open source software outside the world of software developers.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Anthony Ferrara is a prominent member of the PHP community and contributes a great deal of tutorials and materials \"to help people understand complex topics in simple ways\". His blog, about PHP, security, performance and general web application development is at blog at <a href=\"http://blog.ircmaxell.com/\">http://blog.ircmaxell.com/</a> and his YouTube Channel at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/ircmaxell\">http://www.youtube.com/user/ircmaxell</a>.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Opportunities and trickle-down<br></h2>\n<p>\n  \"When I was working on the Joomla project, open source gave me the tools to advance myself, it allowed me to contribute back, to be mentored and to learn, to gain experience in a non-professional setting that I can directly apply to a professional setting. Without those freedoms, I would have never have gotten the experience to be nearly as valuable in a professional context as I am today.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"I can talk about how my life as a developer is improved by open source, how my tools are incredible because they\'re open source, but at the end of the day, I think it\'s really more about how the world benefits from open source. That\'s the most powerful concept: Yes, it helps tons of developers that Drupal is open source, but at the end of the day, developers aren\'t the ones using most of these sites.\" The general public doesn\'t know \"or want to care\" how sites are built. \"They shouldn\'t even know the word Drupal, because what matters at the end of the day are the experiences that are built for them. Open source allows us to build better and faster experiences for the end user.\" Anthony says the benefits to developers of using open source \"trickle down\" to the end users in better experiences on the web.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  The perception of freedom v. actual freedom<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Open source software touches many people every day and most never realize it. You are likely to encounter a product of the Four Freedoms in one or more of the following kinds of systems today: GPS navigation systems, \'smart\' phones, ATMs (bank \'cash machines\'), network routers, entertainments systems, and much more.\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"The sheer usefulness of open source\" means that we can install different versions of the operating system on our phones if they run an open source OS. \"Ten years ago, the mass public had zero idea that something like this was possible. Even today, most people don\'t know about Linux, but they know that they can jailbreak their iPhone. That is the perception of freedom when there isn\'t any. So when you go to platforms like Android, Firefox OS, [or Ubuntu], and you see these mobile phones, the Four Freedoms are making an impact on everybody\'s lives in a meaningful way. I think this is going to continue to grown in the lives of every day people.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Open source and innovation<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Open sourcing innovations lets others recognize your good ideas, put them to good use, learn from them, and improve on them. Inspired by your idea, someone else might make something else new; \"innovation begets innovation\" as it were. \"Amazing things happen because there are people putting in time and effort and then saying \'Do with this what you will.\' Open source is saying \'I value my intellectual property, but I want people to benefit from it.\' You can sell it, of course, that\'s a valid use case; but by sharing it, you\'re allowing other people to benefit and build upon it.\" When others build up on your ideas, you can often benefit from their improvements as much or or as they have benefitted from your contribution, too!\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"The chances of me creating the next huge innovation are relatively small ... the next breakthrough, Web 3.0; the chances of me doing it by myself is almost nothing. But the chance of us as a community doing it, through sharing, through concepts and ideas, the seeds can start from anywhere. It is humbling to think that anybody can be a part of this.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href=\"http://conference.phpbenelux.eu/2013/speakers/#chris-hartjes\">Chris Hartjes</a>, aka \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/grmpyprogrammer\">The Grumpy Programmer</a>\" <a href=\"http://conference.phpbenelux.eu/2013/sessions/#keynote-being-grumpy-for-fun-and-profit\">in his keynote speech at PHP BeNeLux \'13</a> made the point that even scepticism, criticism, or presenting problems is helpful in open source since others can use that information to make improvements.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Four Freedoms are a multiplier. They allow us to multiply our ideas by the thousands of people working with us in our open source projects.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Credits, thank you\'s<br></h3>\n<p>\n  Music for this podcast by <a href=\"http://soundofpicture.com/\">Podington Bear</a>.

He is a Senior Architect at <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/resources/acquia-tv/conference/nbc-universal\" target=\"_blank\">NBCUniversal</a> on a team that works a lot with Drupal. In this first part of a three-part interview, we sat down to talk about open source as an ethos and how it affects business. In the next two parts of our conversation, we talked about the consequences and practice of the Four Freedoms that define open source software, and the security of PHP as a programming language. I\'ll be releasing those soon and updating the links here, too.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Anthony is a prominent member of the PHP community and contributes a great deal of tutorials and materials \"to help people understand complex topics in simple ways\". His blog, about PHP, security, performance and general web application development is at <a href=\"http://blog.ircmaxell.com/\">http://blog.ircmaxell.com/</a> and his YouTube Channel at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/ircmaxell\">http://www.youtube.com/user/ircmaxell</a>.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  The slippery slope to open source<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Like many open source contributors, Anthony got his first small hit of open source (helping a friend with a website, in his case), then went a little deeper (built his own website). The point of no return was probably when he figure out how to fix performance limits on his site and gave the code back to the open source project in question, Joomla. Once they saw his code, the platform\'s maintainers asked him to come in and help. \"In about 6 months,\" explains Anthony, \"I went from releasing my first bit of open source code to becoming a core contributor to a major open source platform.\" He worked on security, maintenance, and performance for the Joomla project for a few years. Antony has now been a PHP core contributor for roughly two years at this point, but also advises and contributes to other open source projects, including Drupal 8.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Experts are made not born<br></h2>\n<p>\n  To make a meaningful contribution to an open source project, you don\'t need to be a \"rockstar\". Good ideas and honest efforts make a real difference. \"There is so much work to be done. The people doing the bleeding-edge stuff don\'t usually have time to do other stuff. Even if you started with a platform yesterday, you can make meaningful contributions.\" Beyond code there is still so much to do: quality assurance, testing, bug reports and validating bug reports by reproducing the problems. \"People underestimate how much of a help that all is,\" and the impact that kind of help can have on a project. It\'s not about being a star,\"The people who are \'famous\' weren\'t famous a year ago. The reason they got famous was because they went forth and put the effort in. They stood up and said: \'I\'ll do that\'. They\'re not some complete genius who the community picked out and said, \'That\'s the guy we want to follow.\' It\'s because they have put in that time, that effort, and they have earned that respect.\" Experts are made not born.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Open source and proprietary coexistence<br></h2>\n<p>\n  \"I use a variety of things from open source video editors to programming languages. I\'m a huge supporter of Linux. Until recently, I only owned Linux computers. I recently had to adopt a Windows machine, but not out of choice ...\" he says while making an inscrutable expression. \"I am a huge believer in the open source movement, but I am also a believer in open source and proprietary living side-by-side. I am not a zealot; I am pragmatic. One example is large data. When you get to extremely large database sizes, it doesn\'t make sense for the open source community to spend time and effort trying to support that when there\'s maybe only a couple hundred users in the world who need that kind of scale. In niche markets, proprietary software can be a benefit to open source projects by alleviating some of the burden of edge case support.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Now that companies like <a href=\"http://www.redhat.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Red Hat</a>, <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/\" target=\"_self\">Acquia</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.canonical.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Canonical</a> offer commercial support for open source projects and \"s long as the corporate backing and the open source project play nice together, the only people who win are everybody.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Building better with open source<br></h2>\n<p>\n  The difference in approach between proprietary and open source software is highlighted by where the investment is made: \"If you go with a proprietary product, you spend a large amount up front and then you have to use it [as is]. Whereas if you go with open source, you don\'t spend nearly as much up front, but you\'ll spend a little bit more over time [for ongoing work on the product], but that little bit more that you\'re spending is directly attributable back to you because you\'re making it do exactly what you need as opposed to changing what you need to [match] what the [proprietary] tool does.\"\n</p>\n</div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n    <div>\n          <div><span><img alt=\"\" title=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"http://www.acquia.com/modules/file/icons/audio-x-generic.png\"><a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/podcasts/ferrara_1-of-3.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg; length=20300760\">ferrara_1-of-3.mp3</a></span></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n<span property=\"dc:title\" content=\" Meet Anthony Ferrara: The only people who win are everybody.\"></span><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/acquiapodcasts/~4/aXtzlfI261k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">','tbc',0,0,'http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/podcasts/ferrara_1-of-3.mp3',NULL,NULL,'en','Meet Anthony Ferrara: The only people who win are everybody.','meet-anthony-ferrara-the-only-people-who-win-are-everybody',1,'Acquia Podcasts','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acquiapodcasts/~3/aXtzlfI261k/acquia-podcast-67-meet-anthony-ferrara',NULL,'2013-02-15','pend'),(229,3,'2013-01-28','<div>\n    <div>\n          <div><div>\n  <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/styles/podcast_author_logo_detail/public/podcasts/author-logo/jam_by_schnitzel_150_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></div>\n</div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n    <div>\n          <div property=\"content:encoded\"><p>\n  Moshe Weizman is Acquia\'s <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/about-us/team/moshe-weitzman\">Director of Research and Development</a> in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisbrookins/status/251355816463040513/photo/1\">Office of the CTO</a>.

That was pretty exciting.\" He obviously got a taste for changing and improving Drupal if you look at a selection of the massive number of contributions he\'s made to the project over the years:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Maintainer of the <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/drush\">Drush project</a>, the excellent command line interface for Drupal developers.\n  </li>\n<li>Maintainer of the <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/devel\">Devel Module</a>, another useful Drupal developer tool.\n  </li>\n<li>Moshe created the original Organic Groups Module (for a children\'s pony show club website for Finnish National Television ... <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/resources/podcasts/acquia-podcast-51-drupal-yle-finland\">I\'m not making this up</a>.)\n  </li>\n<li>He started the <a href=\"http://groups.drupal.org/\">Groups.Drupal.org</a> website, Drupal\'s community- and special-interest group-hub.\n  </li>\n<li>While running Cyrve, a Drupal data-migration company, he was part of developing and open sourcing the <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/migrate\">Migrate Module</a>, which helps anyone move content from other systems into Drupal.\n  </li>\n</ul></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n    <div>\n          <div><span><img alt=\"\" title=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"http://www.acquia.com/modules/file/icons/audio-x-generic.png\"><a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/podcasts/moshe_final_0.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg; length=17854060\">moshe_final.mp3</a></span></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n<span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Meet Moshe Weitzman: Developer Tools, Product Development, Drupal History\"></span><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/acquiapodcasts/~4/qqyUlMuPR2U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">','tbc',0,0,'http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/podcasts/moshe_final_0.mp3',NULL,NULL,'en','Meet Moshe Weitzman: Developer Tools, Product Development, Drupal History','meet-moshe-weitzman-developer-tools-product-development-drupal-history',1,'Acquia Podcasts','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acquiapodcasts/~3/qqyUlMuPR2U/acquia-podcast-66-meet-moshe-weitzman',NULL,'2013-02-15','pend'),(230,3,'2013-01-18','<div>\n    <div>\n          <div><div>\n  <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/styles/podcast_author_logo_detail/public/podcasts/author-logo/jam_by_schnitzel_150_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></div>\n</div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n    <div>\n          <div property=\"content:encoded\"><p>\n  <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/about-us/team/erik-webb\">Erik Webb</a> &ndash; aka \"Southern Gentleman\" within his team &ndash; Senior Technical Consultant with Acquia\'s <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/products-services/professional-services\" title=\"Professional Services\" target=\"_blank\">Professional Services</a> group helps some of the \"biggest Drupal users\" in his job. In any given week, he might be doing anything from training people brand new to Drupal, to performance tuning and everything in between to make projects succeed. \"I helped a Fortune 100 company move their entire web presence to Drupal.\" At this scale, Erik\'s job is about how to take Drupal to that next level and making it something that works for millions of people,\" day in and day out. \"The Drupal community is really about trying to make an experience and make something that people want to come back to.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Deep roots in open source<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Erik is a long term user of GNU Linux, with a sysadmin background, he\'s also Red Hat certified. Though he didn\'t know it when he set out on his road to Drupal, it was a series of logical steps that got him where he is today. \"Being a good systems administrator, you know how to program, you know what languages look like, so you pick up PHP. Once you pick up PHP, you write some really ugly applications and you realise other people are doing this, too, so you pick up frameworks. I worked with Symfony and Code Igniter. Then you say, \'well a framework\'s great, but there\'s still so much I have to do,\" and you eventually reach Drupal. Now you can focus on the cool part of the website and you can let all the really basic stuff that you\'d have to do all the time, you let Drupal take care of that for you so you can enjoy your job more.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Contributing to Drupal<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Since Erik finds himself in many different parts of the United States in the curse of his job, he uses any opportunity to go to local Drupal user groups, meet ups, and events like <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/community/resources/events\" title=\"Drupal Camps\" target=\"_blank\">Drupal Camps</a>: LA, Georgia, Boston, North Carolina and more. \"That\'s what sets the Drupal community apart. You can be out there and sharing source code &ndash; and that\'s fantastic &ndash; but at a certain point it\'s really great to see people, talk to them about what they\'re doing with Drupal. I don\'t think there\'s any better feeling than seeing someone at a Drupal Camp as a new Drupalist and then a year and a half later you see them again and they say, \'Hey, I\'ve been working on this really cool project!\' To see all that grow, that\'s what makes community to me. Not the size or the content, but how we bring people into it and how we mature those people.\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"One of the things I love most about the travel in my job is that I get to see so many different people. Being able to connect them, creating a sort of mesh-network, I can bring all these people together. Once they\'re sharing, then they know someone else, and they can share experiences. I fee like being at Acquia and having the luxury to travel and see all these cities and people, we\'re in a unique position to be at the center of this kind of matchmaking.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This interview was recorded in 2012.\n</p>\n</div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n    <div>\n          <div><span><img alt=\"\" title=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"http://www.acquia.com/modules/file/icons/audio-x-generic.png\"><a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/podcasts/erik_webb_final.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg; length=22826285\">erik_webb_final.mp3</a></span></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n<span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Meet Erik Webb, the southern gentleman helping Drupal projects succeed\"></span><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/acquiapodcasts/~4/gjvkBnKAJis\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">','tbc',0,0,'http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/podcasts/erik_webb_final.mp3',NULL,NULL,'en','Meet Erik Webb, the southern gentleman helping Drupal projects succeed','meet-erik-webb-the-southern-gentleman-helping-drupal-projects-succeed',1,'Acquia Podcasts','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acquiapodcasts/~3/gjvkBnKAJis/acquia-podcast-65-meet-erik-webb',NULL,'2013-02-15','pend'),(231,3,'2013-01-11','<div>\n    <div>\n          <div><div>\n  <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/styles/podcast_author_logo_detail/public/podcasts/author-logo/jam_by_schnitzel_150.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></div>\n</div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n    <div>\n          <div property=\"content:encoded\"><p>\n  Andrew Melck, Solutions Architect on the Pre-Sales Team in Acquia Europe is the subject of the first Acquia podcast of 2013.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Andrew came to Acquia and Drupal from a German digital agency where he had experience with both open source and proprietary technologies. He was excited to encounter Drupal as a PHP project with global scope and for the fact that, \"When I downloaded it the first time, it just ran. I grasped how this thing worked and how you could plug stuff together very quickly. It seemed very straightforward.\" Compared to Typo3\'s \"dispiriting\" back end, \"I found it really interesting how you could even mod the Drupal back end for specific roles and specific purposes.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Regarding content reuse, Drupal\'s content-first model of site architecture was a positive change for him after dealing with the consequences of incorrectly architected Sharepoint or Typo3 sites &ndash; which a use hierarchy-first model &ndash; where users end up not being able to share content between multiple parts of a site.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  What is a Solutions Architect at Acquia?<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Andrew says, \"Solutions architects support the Sales team on large projects. We help assess whether Drupal is a good fit and then work with the Sales rep to scope out how Acquia can make a meaningful offering and maybe bring in partners to complete the deal.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"If we can move through the initial RFI (Request for Information) phase, where there will often be a large number of vendors invited, we\'ll get to an \'RFP\' (Request for Proposals) phase with fewer vendors. My colleagues and I will then help write documentation the explains what we can do technically and commercially for the proposed project. If we get into the final phase, we\'ll prepare demos, build sites and proofs of concept to demonstrate what Drupal can do. We\'ve got experience with a lot of clients and can also provide the back-stories [needed to help choose a Drupal solution]. An anecdote is often worth a lot more than 500 lines of code as a proof.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Open source is about best of breed solutions<br></h2>\n<p>\n  A solutions architect needs to have a deep knowledge of parallel and competitive technologies, to be able to assess \"what the business case is for making a change [i.e. switching to Drupal] or making some kind of modification to the overall setup. For example, if you\'ve got a situation where Sharepoint is being used as a document management system, Drupal can be put on top of Sharepoint as the web interface, and you can surface your Sharepoint documents using CMIS - a standard integration that can be used with Sharepoint, or its open source alternative, Alfresco.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"<a href=\"http://www.alfresco.com/\">Alfreso.com</a> &ndash; a Drupal site &ndash; is a good example of how you can do this. Alfresco have moved away from providing their own web platform; they now recommend using Drupal as their front end. This is another great example of the way that Drupal and open source is all about using a best of breed approach. In this case, the backend technology is Java, the front is end PHP, and we\'re using standard connectors to put those together.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  What\'s hot in the enterprise?<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Responsive design aka \"mobile first\" is huge. \"The way Drupal 8 is going to be responsive out of the door for the back end as well. People are really interested.\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"Companies are interested in the whole <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/solutions/web-experience-management\" title=\"OpenWEM\" target=\"_self\">Web Experience Management and Engagement Management (WEM)</a> area. The way that different authors can work with a system, the way that you\'ll be able to edit content in place with true WYSIWYG; that kind of stuff is really important. That\'s one of the areas that people really care about.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Drupal distributions - accelerators and conversation starters<br></h2>\n<p>\n  A distribution is a preconfigured instance of Drupal, ready for a particular use-case: <a href=\"http://commerceguys.com/commerce-kickstart-version-two\">eCommerce</a>, <a href=\"http://julio.funnymonkey.com/\">schools</a>, <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/pushtape\">musician websites</a>, <a href=\"http://usecod.com/\">conference management</a> and so on. Acquia maintains a couple of <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/downloads\" title=\"Free Downloads\" target=\"_self\">Drupal distributions</a>, including <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/products-services/drupal-commons-social-business-software\" title=\"Social Business Software\" target=\"_self\">Drupal Commons</a> is one such distribution. \"Acquia likes to call Commons an accelerator. Commons is a great way of communicating what value Drupal can provide to a company and the way we can help to boost the initial development phase. Commons is a toolset for any social business collaboration platform.\" If Commons fulfils 80% of your needs out-of-the-box, your project is going to be faster and cheaper to get to full implementation; especially because you can leverage the broad landscape of thousands Drupal contributed modules and tested solutions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"Commons is a great story for people when they are first learning about Drupal, first learning about what Acquia does. We\'re bringing people in, who then get into a conversation with us, where we can work out if Commons is the solution they need. We don\'t see Commons as THE PRODUCT that we just put on the table, take it or leave it. We see it as a door opener, a conversation starter that allows us to provide them with what should be the optimum solution.\"\n</p>\n</div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n    <div>\n          <div><span><img alt=\"\" title=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"http://www.acquia.com/modules/file/icons/audio-x-generic.png\"><a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/podcasts/andrew_melck_final.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg; length=26202705\">andrew_melck_final.mp3</a></span></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n<span property=\"dc:title\" content=\'Meet Andrew Melck: \"Drupal means best of breed solutions\"\'></span><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/acquiapodcasts/~4/5YQ-1x5Pr-g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">','tbc',0,0,'http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/podcasts/andrew_melck_final.mp3',NULL,NULL,'en','Meet Andrew Melck: \"Drupal means best of breed solutions\"','meet-andrew-melck-drupal-means-best-of-breed-solutions',1,'Acquia Podcasts','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acquiapodcasts/~3/5YQ-1x5Pr-g/acquia-podcast-64-meet-andrew-melck',NULL,'2013-02-15','pend'),(232,3,'2012-12-21','<div>\n    <div>\n          <div><div>\n  <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/styles/podcast_author_logo_detail/public/podcasts/author-logo/jam_by_Schnitzel_150_18.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></div>\n</div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n    <div>\n          <div property=\"content:encoded\"><p>\n  <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/about-us/team/chris-pliakas\">Chris Pliakas</a> is a solutions architect at Acquia. He works closely with the Acquia sales representatives and potential clients \"to help people who might not know about Drupal or might be considering a proprietary solution see how Drupal can help them. It\'s really great to be out on the front lines helping people to see Drupal the way we do.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Chris is also a search and data management expert and and the Product Owner of <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-network/cloud-services/acquia-search\">Acquia Search</a>. He makes the point that open data is only useful \"if you can find it and make meaningful findings from that data. Search is a way to do that.\" Chris is especially focused on data-visualisations and the <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/facetapi\">Facet API module</a> that provides a common interface for the various faceted search technologies and implementations in Drupal: Apache Solr, Search API, and so on.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  On getting started with Drupal and open source<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Chris is a musician and came to technology through building PC systems for audio recording at university. The reasons he had for getting started with open source software (\"Open source makes it easy to play with stuff; you don\'t have to buy it.\") are another way of expressing one of the ways it also minimises risk in a business context: Failure, improvement, and innovation are cheaper with open source software.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Chris started learning about the web when he needed a website. Learning PHP was followed by the discovery that \"I could actually make a career out of that!\" and he went on to become a certified MySQL developer and administrator, LPIC certified, and a certified PHP engineer-developer.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  On leveraging the power of community-built software<br></h2>\n<p>\n  He joined a company as a junior sys-admin and \"they kinda forced me to use Drupal.\" It was love at first sight, \"The first four months, I hated Drupal, with red-faced, keyboard-pounding, fist-clenching hatred.\" The change from hand-coding everything from scratch to learning to take advantage of Drupal came with an aha-moment: \"A lot of problems have already been solved in Drupal and if I change my attitude, then I can leverage what really smart people are doing.\" Drupal gives you a head start, \"I get to do all the interesting things that I\'d never be able to do if I were doing it all myself.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"Working with Drupal gave me a career doing something that I love and that I feel has the ability to change the world. Working on the technical pre-sales side of things, I have a lot of discussions with people who are adopting proprietary solutions. The mindset is totally different; all the data is locked in, it\'s tough to get to, it\'s tough to extrapolate. With an open platform, that data is able to be shared and propagated. That\'s really important. Drupal allows anybody to get that information out there so that people can make the best decisions possible.\"\n</p>\n</div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n    <div>\n          <div><span><img alt=\"\" title=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"http://www.acquia.com/modules/file/icons/audio-x-generic.png\"><a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/podcasts/Chris_Pliakas.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg; length=27023973\">Chris_Pliakas.mp3</a></span></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n<span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Meet Chris Pliakas: Open software and open data make for better decisions\"></span><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/acquiapodcasts/~4/eJ1D_V3IPVQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">','tbc',0,0,'http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/podcasts/Chris_Pliakas.mp3',NULL,NULL,'en','Meet Chris Pliakas: Open software and open data make for better decisions','meet-chris-pliakas-open-software-and-open-data-make-for-better-decisions',1,'Acquia Podcasts','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acquiapodcasts/~3/eJ1D_V3IPVQ/acquia-podcast-63-meet-chris-pliakas',NULL,'2013-02-15','pend'),(233,3,'2012-12-15','<div>\n    <div>\n          <div><div>\n  <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/styles/podcast_author_logo_detail/public/podcasts/author-logo/jam_by_Schnitzel_150_17.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></div>\n</div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n    <div>\n          <div property=\"content:encoded\"><p>\n  <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/about-us/team/michael-hofmockel\">Michael Hofmockel</a> is a technical consultant at Acquia, based in Ames Iowa. Like many Drupalists, Michael\'s background wasn\'t in computer science, but led him to Drupal nonetheless. As he puts it, \"Drupal\'s great because you can come at it from almost any angle ... and we do!\" Michael was building databases as a soil chemist at Duke University. When he needed a web interface for a database, \"I decided not to build it for myself, tried Drupal and I never needed anything else again!\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Note: This podcast was recorded using Skype and the sound quality varies in places.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  The first Drupal Camp wedding?<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Michael helps run the <a href=\"http://groups.drupal.org/iowa\">Iowa Drupal user group</a>, which recently wrapped up their 2nd successful <a href=\"http://2012.drupalcorn.org/\">\"Drupal Corn\" camp</a>. Friends of mine <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/28783323\">got engaged during a DrupalCon London presentation</a>, but as far as I know the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/drupalcorn/7722724104/in/pool-drupalcorn_2012\">Drupal Corn wedding</a> was a first in the Drupal community.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Drupal then and now<br></h2>\n<p>\n  The first Drupal version Michael used was 4.5 more than seven years ago &ndash; very old school! For those of you who might not remember, there was not only no CCK, there were no content types, not even <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/flexinode\">flexi-node</a> (bonus points if you still remember that!) ... \"So if you needed a node type, you wrote it. There was good bit of user interface, but as far as customisation and new features went, you were writing everything yourself. Drupal 7 is a lot more stacking of modules and configuration and a lot less code\" compared to older versions. \"That\'s not to say you don\'t ever write code in Drupal 7, but you\'re a lot more surgical with your code.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Getting up to speed with Drupal<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Drupal core can only do so much, as Michael points out. To make it really sing, you need to start adding contributed modules. Getting to know which of the thousands of them do what you need and how best to configure them is important. If you\'re new to Drupal, Michael\'s reviews of the \"Using Drupal\" books are a great place to start (as are the books themselves: they contain \"recipes\" to build common site types and functionalities):\n</p>\n<ul><li>Using Drupal (Drupal 6) module tour: <a href=\"http://groups.drupal.org/node/18669\">http://groups.drupal.org/node/18669</a>\n  </li>\n<li>Using Drupal (Drupal 7) module tour: <a href=\"http://groups.drupal.org/node/224559\">http://groups.drupal.org/node/224559</a>\n  </li>\n</ul><p>\n  The reviews give you two nice, vetted lists of modules. Michael recently presented a session at <a href=\"http://drupalcampchicago.org/\">Drupal Camp Chicago</a> entitled \"45 modules in 45 minutes.\" Grab the slides <a href=\"http://drupalcampchicago.org/sessions/45-modules-45-minutes\">here</a>, it\'s a strong list of what to go investigate, too. We\'ll be exploring those 45 modules and more in upcoming Acquia \"Module Minute\" podcasts, too!\n</p>\n<h2>\n  On working at Acquia<br></h2>\n<p>\n  \"I have teammates who are really awesome and look out for me, and help me when I need help.

When he first looked at Drupal 5, his first thought was, \"That interface could be better,\" but, \"It\'s a totally different story if you start today. The interface is much better and the learning curve is less steep. Drupal now is a completely different game; you have a lot more people working on it, contributed modules are much higher quality. Big companies are using Drupal now, which it wasn\'t really ready for back then. The community contributes a lot more now and at a faster pace.\"\n</p>\n<h2>On Drupal at scale<br></h2>\n<p>\n  \"The requirements that big organisations look for in Drupal are different and harder to achieve than the ones you might look for when building a small website, so a lot of thought and direction needs to go into them. The combined needs of these groups has put Drupal in an interesting place, \"it is both flexible, customisable, and really scalable.\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"The biggest competitive strength of Drupal is that different companies are all driving it in the same direction,\" and contributing back to the project. \"Most companies that customise closed-source software never contribute back or share their work with anyone. They don\'t even share with other companies that are not competition to leverage their efforts. So having everyone driving Drupal to a good spot helps to drive a better product. Companies also understand that it is a really good way to recruit the best talent in Drupal. Making what you do visible to the community is one of the best decisions you can make.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  On working at Acquia<br></h2>\n<p>\n  \"I am lucky. I have a job that is uncommon: It is really uncommon to have a different challenge every week, a different client every week ... and getting to work in totally different industries with totally different requirements and expectations, moving from governments, to universities, to media companies. Despite all that, you can help them: the technological and business problems are things you know and can solve, leveraging your previous experiences.\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"I have never seen a place where people love to work for the company so much. I think the key is that people have a lot of freedom and a lot of responsibility at the same time. This drives them to be passionate about what they are doing. When you work for a startup, you usually feel you have more ownership of what you do. You feel that whatever you do has more impact. At Acquia it\'s interesting because even though we\'re a small company, we\'re always working with big corporations,\" so you have to be aware of both mindsets.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  On being \'hernani\'<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Hern&acirc;ni says his Drupal.org username is <a href=\"http://drupal.org/user/448086\">hernani</a>, \"because it\'s a really weird name and I couldn\'t change it.\"\n</p>\n</div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n    <div>\n          <div><span><img alt=\"\" title=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"http://www.acquia.com/modules/file/icons/audio-x-generic.png\"><a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/podcasts/Hernani-12_0.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg; length=23957611\">Hernani-12.mp3</a></span></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n<span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Meet Hern&acirc;ni Borges de Freitas: Drupal at scale\"></span><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/acquiapodcasts/~4/01xDW1B97jQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">','tbc',0,0,'http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/podcasts/Hernani-12_0.mp3',NULL,NULL,'en','Meet Hernâni Borges de Freitas: Drupal at scale','meet-hernni-borges-de-freitas-drupal-at-scale',1,'Acquia Podcasts','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acquiapodcasts/~3/01xDW1B97jQ/acquia-podcast-60-meet-hernani',NULL,'2013-02-15','pend'),(236,3,'2012-09-21','<div>\n    <div>\n          <div><div>\n  <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/styles/podcast_author_logo_detail/public/podcasts/author-logo/jam_by_Schnitzel_150_14.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></div>\n</div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n    <div>\n          <div property=\"content:encoded\"><h2>\n  \"Here\'s how Drupal can do that.\"<br></h2>\n<p>\n  As Senior Director of Solutions Architecture at Acquia, <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/about-us/team/christian-yates\">Christian Yates</a> makes sure that Drupal is able to compete head-to-head with any and all competing technologies. He translates organizations\' business needs into a vision of how Drupal can solve the large-scale, complex problems that large organizations face. Since showing and doing is always better than saying, he also builds proofs-of-concept in working code to help get them on board with Drupal.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Going from static to Drupal<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Christian was head of interactive and information technology for a regional division of McClatchy Newspapers, the 2nd largest newspaper company in the US. When the company decided to move off Vignette and replace it with a Perl-based publishing system that was unfortunately still static ...\n</p>\n<p>\n  He says, \"I needed a tool that solved the business need of [adding] this newfangled idea of user-generated content, and blogs, and interactivity, and dynamic elements to a static site. We looked at a number of open source and proprietary solutions and selected Drupal to start implementing commenting systems, and blogs, and video systems, all sorts of stuff ... It was able to plug right in because it had very rich support for creating new things quickly ...\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"We looked at a number of solutions, Wordpress, Mambo (now Joomla) ... and settled on Drupal because of the flexibility of the APIs, the technical merits, but also the merits of working with the community, being able to reuse a lot of the efforts that were coming out of the community to save us time and development ... and contribute back where we could.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Drupal: faster results, faster improvements<br></h2>\n<p>\n  \"In the past, if we had to build a project, we were going to do it from scratch; it was a long-term project. It might take a couple of months to get even a minor feature for the site up and running. But with Drupal we were able to execute on our ideas much more quickly, so we could have a meeting on a Monday to discuss what we needed, and by Friday, we could have something working and having the public give us feedback on it! And then could iterate on that and improve it, but we could do that so much faster [with Drupal] than we could in the past.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Contributing to Drupal beyond code<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Christian has written and contributed back a fair share of Drupal code over the years. How he contributes now as a solutions architect is perhaps less direct, but important in other ways. As part of the process of getting large organizations to use Drupal for big IT and web projects, solutions architects like Christian prepare working demo installations, functional proofs-of-concept, and responses to \"RFPs\" (the \"requests for proposals\" that are often a part of the bidding process for large projects). \"I go in and sell the benefits of Drupal to really large organizations.\" If Drupal wins the day at one of these, it can result in hundreds or thousands of new Drupal installations and new business, new jobs for Drupalists and Drupal shops, and new advocates for Drupal.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A major factor that is helping Drupal win over large, established proprietary players in these cases, is the Drupal community and that everyone involved in the project are all an active part of Drupal. When you engage with Drupal the right way, you are not just consuming something presented to you, take it or leave it. You are choosing the power and freedom to build and refine the perfect tools for your specific needs, while experiencing massive time and financial savings thanks to all the other contributors past and present.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Christian\'s contribution is to \"make sure that Drupal is able to compete head-to-head,\" with Salesforce, Oracle, and others, \"and get that kind of visibility.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"Working closely with people like Warner Music Group, we raise the profile of Drupal beyond the people who know about it, and surface it to other markets where it can be taken seriously as a solution for solving really big problems. Warner Brothers are so enthusiastic about it that they will get up and promote this fact to the recording industry, Billboard magazine, and to the larger community of media and entertainment companies.\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"That scale of adoption and level of enthusiasm for Drupal-as-a-tool; and that Drupal is a good thing to bet your future on; that Drupal will make you successful; this is going to draw more talent and significant users into the Drupal community. I think it\'s going to keep feeding on itself.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Deep geek cred &ndash; Christian\'s road to Acquia<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Christian came to Acquia by way of some experiences many of us would envy. He went from managing IT teams to (wow!) working on a project at <a href=\"http://buytaert.net/drupal-goes-to-mars\">the NASA Mars Space Flight Facility at Arizona State University</a>. He describes it, \"... did some interesting stuff that showed how Drupal can work in ways that you might not normally use it. I built applications for managing spacecraft metadata, managing infrared spectroscopy data. That\'s interesting stuff that you don\'t normally think of using Drupal for. I think it was a natural slot into what I do today, which is to figure out how Drupal can work for you ... Take your interesting/crazy idea and say: Here\'s how Drupal can do that.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  On working at Acquia<br></h2>\n<p>\n  \"There\'s a lot of hours, but there\'s a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of teamwork.

When Netscape created the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Organization\">Mozilla Organization</a> and open sourced its browser\'s source code in 1998, Kent more or less wrote the action off as a novelty. When Jay Batson called him ten years later about coming to Acquia, Kent wasn\'t interested. \"How can you make a business out of this? Who can have a job if [the software is] free?\". Kent convinced himself open source software was a viable business proposition once he understood that any application, free or otherwise, needs \"implementation and ongoing caring and feeding ... and that\'s where you can add value and expertise\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Kent\'s team of dedicated, hard working Drupal experts helps to fulfill customer\'s needs and solve their problems. As he rightly says, \"The point of any support organization is to make your customers successful.\" Where Acquia\'s support differs from proprietary product-support, however, in that it supports any and every custom implementation of Drupal, making it a larger, more flexible, and probably more interesting problem space.\n</p>\n<p>\n  One vital difference in Drupal and open source software is that instead of having one choice (use it or don\'t use it), everyone who is using Drupal is also working to change and improve it at the same time. Acquia\'s support team, therefore is also making constant improvements to Drupal and its modules based on real-world problems they encounter \"in the trenches\" every day with hundreds of clients.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Kent\'s insight once he wrapped his head around the open source way of doing things: \"This struck me as unique and exciting; customers were not stuck with what they had. They could change it on their own. They could wait for the community members to help change it, but they were not stuck. Everybody was in flight at the same time in improving, developing, and using the software.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Making a difference in Drupal<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Kent points out that the Acquia Support team helps get patches back into Drupal, but they also help customers (Drupal developers!) focus on best practices, to help them be successful and have a good experience with Drupal ... helping people out of the \"Drupal just doesn\'t work\" trap of bad implementations ...\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Support team also makes sure clients who may be new to Drupal or open source understand how it all works. Once the work they\'re doing is needed by other people, other companies and how valuable it is when they contribute it back. \"And we\'ve helped them understand the benefit that they receive by others doing that as well.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Making a difference in the world<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Kent gives a great, inside perspective on how the Acquia Support and other teams all pulled together to make sure Al-Masry Al-Youm, Egypt\'s largest independent media outlet, was able to cover recent elections in that country.

They are in the happy position of being able to train client-developers in best practices, choosing and using the right Drupal modules, how to use the open source process, and more. Kenny says, \"The Support Department gives Drupal sites the TLC they need.\" All of this results in happier and more successful Drupal users and a healthier Drupal project.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Supporting Acquia Support<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Keeping his team happy and on track is quite a challenge, considering he himself describes a typical day in Support as \"One large forest fire from dawn till dusk ... in any time zone ... We wake up on fire and go to bed on fire,\" Kenny laughs at this point, \"and dream on fire ... But that\'s the job that we love and that\'s what we do.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"What we provide here is so different from consumer-level support, it\'s a step above that. There\'s a heavy level of involvement with our customers and a heavy commitment to them.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  From partner to Acquian<br></h2>\n<p>\n  After working for an Acquia partner and being laid off in 2009, Kenny got a call from a recruiter who said, \"Hey, you\'re <a href=\"http://drupal.org/user/246154\">webkenny</a>!\" ... \"Have you ever heard of Acquia?\" :-) Nine interviews later, an Acquian was born!\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"I learned large sites while I was here.\" Now Kenny is one of Acquia\'s go-to experts on site performance. Kenny\'s job lets him expand his technical knowledge and use his people skills to provide top-notch technical support. \"Acquia has really grown my knowledge as well as my career.\" Being at Acquia has also allowed him to flourish as a presenter in the Drupal and technical communities, too. He gets to combine his stage skills with what he knows to create compelling teaching experiences and spread the word about Drupal.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  A career from cold to hot<br></h2>\n<p>\n  From being a ColdFusion developer, Kenny moved to PHP in 2007, and heard about Drupal in 2008. From there, he got a Drupal job and went to his first <a href=\"https://association.drupal.org/drupalcon\">DrupalCon</a> in <a href=\"http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/\">Washington D.C. in 2009</a>. By 2011, he was presenting his own sessions at Drupal events, including at <a href=\"http://london2011.drupal.org/conference/sessions/living-breathing-drupal-biology-request\">DrupalCon London</a>.

It should be possible to do most of what you want to configure in the UI ... We strongly discourage people from using PHP snippets now. I also got used to Drupal when there was no admin theme, no pretense of a separation between the front end and the back end.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Joining Acquia<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Peter made a radical career change &ndash; from biophysicist to full-time software engineer &ndash; thanks to his significant, spare-time contributions to Drupal 6. He got a phone call from <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/about-us/team/dries-buytaert\">Dries</a> and ended up one of Acquia\'s earliest hires. Peter has been involved in the development of many of its products, including the <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-network\">Acquia Network</a> and its very first service: <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-network/cloud-services/acquia-search\">Acquia Search</a>.

Acquia Search is a turnkey solution, but the Drupal modules can be used by anyone who can set up their own Apache Solr servers to seamlessly integrate them with their Drupal sites, too.\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"We know all the contributions we make make Drupal more attractive to enterprises or anyone who wants to make search a part of their site.\" no matter how people are taking advantage of Apache Solr, through Acquia or elsewhere.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  The best part of working for Acquia<br></h2>\n<p>\n  \"We are changing the world through promoting open source and getting people to use it.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  On working remotely<br></h2>\n<p>\n  \"It mostly looks like I\'m sitting around the house\" :-)\n</p>\n</div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n    <div>\n          <div><span><img alt=\"\" title=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"http://www.acquia.com/modules/file/icons/audio-x-generic.png\"><a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/podcasts/Peter_Wolanin_1.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg; length=20659567\">Peter_Wolanin_1.mp3</a></span></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n<span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Meet Peter Wolanin: We are changing the world.\"></span><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/acquiapodcasts/~4/8R-CBQ1eYmg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">','tbc',0,0,'http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/podcasts/Peter_Wolanin_1.mp3',NULL,NULL,'en','Meet Peter Wolanin: We are changing the world.','meet-peter-wolanin-we-are-changing-the-world',1,'Acquia Podcasts','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acquiapodcasts/~3/8R-CBQ1eYmg/acquia-podcast-56-meet-peter-wolanin',NULL,'2013-02-15','pend'),(240,3,'2012-07-25','<div>\n    <div>\n          <div><div>\n  <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/styles/podcast_author_logo_detail/public/podcasts/author-logo/drupalconnect_7_12.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></div>\n</div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n    <div>\n          <div property=\"content:encoded\"><p>\n  As a result of Randy Fay\'s blog posts and Drupalcon Denver core conversation on Drupal governance (see show notes for links), Dries Buytaert convened a working group to define the first steps in the refinement of Drupal governance.

This has turned into one of the <a href=\"http://network.acquia.com/\">Acquia Network\'s</a> crown jewels, <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-network/cloud-services/insight\">Insight</a>, which monitors hundreds of metrics on live Drupal sites and offers not only alerts for more than 170 kinds of potential problems, it also proactively suggests ways you can improve your site\' performance, SEO optimization, and more.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  The road to Drupal and Acquia<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Michael started in IT on the SysOps side, managing \"half the Unreal Tournament servers in the world from 1999-2003,\" and \"hundreds of thousands of Counterstrike games on 350 physical servers in 7 data centers,\" on his own. He was tempted into the software side of things when he noticed that, unlike sysadmins, the programmers get to go home and sleep ... :-)\n</p>\n<p>\n  He started doing some PHP and his expertise in performance and large-scale development. He built and ran a large network of sites on his own CMS for a large automotive supply company, but left when they were bought out. Drupal 3 was not quite what he was looking for when he checked it out, and he started developing using the Code Igniter framework. After a while Michael got sick of repeating the same tasks over and over and came to the conclusion that building the same components again and again \"is just stupid,\" and had another look at Drupal. Drupal 5 was doing \"everything he wanted\" and he was hooked.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Michael moved on to Kaspersky and worked with <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/resources/podcasts/acquia-podcast-53-meet-katelyn-fogarty\">Acquia\'s Kate Fogarty</a>. They converted all Kaspersky\'s Americas websites to Drupal over a year and a half. When the company decided to move the sites to something else, Michael said, \"I want to go to the company where Drupal is always the right answer.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  And he got there, too ...\n</p>\n<h2>\n  On Drupal for freelancers<br></h2>\n<p>\n  \"It allowed me to make a heck of a lot more money than I would have if I had had to build everything from scratch. Every project could be more profitable because I wan\'t having to build everything over and over again or architect everything myself.\" Kids! Listen to Michael!\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Working at Acquia<br></h2>\n<p>\n  \"I get to live my dream: building really cool software that I love to make, building tools and applications that make people\'s lives better, that people are excited to use. I get to do it all through this system that has a great community, a lot of great collaborators, and a really strong codebase that is easy to work with. Acquia is a place where all they do is make awesome things with Drupal!\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  About Acquia Insight<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Acquia offers its technical staff so-called \"gardening days\" to work on Drupal issue queues, side projects, and new ideas. Michael came to Acquia with experience in managing large stables of websites. \"Except for the Update Status page, which only checks modules, within Drupal itself, there\'s no really way to tell if things need to be done on your site. When I came to Acquia, I saw the power of the <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/acquia_connector\">Acquia Connector Module</a>, that could sit on someone\'s website and provide us information about their website. It had this enormous potential to be extended ... we could built dashboards on our end and show them all sorts of information about their website.\" Hey presto a gardening days project was born! Today, we call it <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-network/cloud-services/insight\">Insight</a> and it comes with every Acquia Network subscription, anyone running a Drupal site can have a subscription, not just those on Acquia Cloud.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  What does Acquia Insight do for Drupal site owners?<br></h2>\n<p>\n  \"I refer to it as an ongoing audit of your website,\" says Michael, all on one place, \"it allows you to see if modules need to be updated, if configuration has been changed, if your stack is configured properly. It also has an add-on called \"SEO Grader\" that helps you configure your Drupal site for SEO.\" Insight will alert you proactively, too: \"A great example is someone\'s debugging the site at nine at night, they turn off page caching and forget to turn it back on. The next day you hit Reddit or something and your site goes down. With Insight you can configure it to get alerts, so you could get an email alert and go back and turn on page caching before the problem ever became a big deal.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Centralized information gives you better sites for less effort<br></h2>\n<p>\n  \"We want to help everybody make their websites more secure, make their websites run better. It\'s good for all of us if Drupal is perceived to be a more secure, more performant solution.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even if 80% of the information Insight provides can be easily pulled from any given site, Insight does so automatically, all the time and includes proactive optimization suggestions and alerts for 170 different types of potential problems, proactive optimization recommendations, code change diffs, and more.\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"Any good Drupal developer, everything we have in Insight, they a) already know, or b) could probably figure out relatively easily. This is all based on what the community knows about Drupal. Our Support team has come up with some new things, based on their experience supporting thousands of Drupal websites. But you\'re not always the only one on your site! Someone else could be in there playing around. Sometimes you turn over admin control to a client and they destroy it and they come and get angry at you. Insight can alert when they make these changes, contact them and help fix it proactively, everybody looks better.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Show notes<br></h2>\n<ul><li>\n    <a href=\"http://network.acquia.com/\">Acquia Network</a>: answers, site management tools, and support when you need it for any Drupal site\n  </li>\n<li>\n    <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-network/cloud-services/insight\">Insight</a>: \"Be a Drupal hero.\" Acquia Insight takes the mystery out of Drupal tuning and management, giving you greater visibility and control over your sites.\n  </li>\n<li>\n    <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/acquia_connector\">Acquia Connector Module</a>\n  </li>\n<li>Since this interview, Michael has published the science fiction novel, \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Outsystem-Aeon-14-ebook/dp/B008GZ8HEM\">Outsystem</a>\" ...

When he found Drupal in 2004, he went from hacking it (Drupalists commonly refer to changing core code the wrong way as \"killing kittens\" &ndash; it\'s a bad practice if you care about the stability and security of your Drupal site), to realizing his dream by contributing his own modules and becoming a core contributor to Drupal 7. Now in the Drupal 8 release cycle, a big part of his job is to \"unstick\" and facilitate the Drupal 8 development process.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  From Gardens to OCTO<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Until recently, Alex was part of the engineering team building <a href=\"http://drupalgardens.com/\">Drupal Gardens</a>. He\'s now in the Acquia Office of the CTO, aka \"OCTO\", which he describes as \"helping to scale Dries\" by taking care of the Drupal project and community contributions to help Dries Buytaert be more effective as Drupal\'s Project Lead.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Drupal 4.7 v.

We knew that it was something we could live with.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"In hindsight, I\'m pretty proud about the decision to choose Drupal, because our idea about Drupal turned out to be correct.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"The competition is tougher today, but Drupal is still good in the ways it was back then.\"\n</p>\n<h3>\n  The importance of making good choices<br></h3>\n<p>\n  \"Once you make a decision in a large and complicated organization, once you start using something, you\'re going to have to live with it [for a long time].\" This has consequences ranging from the longevity and viability of a given technology, to differences in cost and investment when comparing open source and proprietary solutions.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Sami Kallinen - The new broadcasting<br></h2>\n<p>\n  <a href=\"http://drupal.org/user/430527\">Sami Kallinen</a>, the head of the web for the minority, Swedish language section of the YLE talks about Drupal\'s role in the the strategic, planning and implementation processes for a broadcasting company to start producing content with a web-first approach.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Centering on a single technology<br></h3>\n<p>\n  The Swedish division of the YLE was trying to run and maintain between 5 and 20 home-brew site systems that were increasingly difficult to maintain. At one point, they fell victim to the notorious \'Truck Test\' when the lead developer of a particular site system left for a competitor and no one else knew how to develop that system any further. This was the signal that it was time to consolidate all the systems and they chose Drupal.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Mobile first, content-driven structures<br></h3>\n<p>\n  Following a lot of careful research, hiring, consultation, and planning the Swedish division of the YLE launched svenska.yle.fi on Drupal. It is a fantastic, mobile-first, responsive-designed news site. The YLE Swedish team created a specialized \"flat\" editorial workflow that allows them to enter content once, then use and re-use it as \"promos\" and in larger collections of content across various parts of the site. Anyone among the hundreds of people in the Swedish content team can create new items and publish them anywhere on the site within 5 minutes: from local traffic jams, to breaking news, to the Eurovision Song Contest. The content team builds the site, not the technical people.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Carl-Magnus Dumell - Drupal is a multiplier<br></h2>\n<p>\n  Carl Magnus talks about the benefits of using community-driven software in the enterprise: \"It\'s easy to find people who know the system. If you need a team to work on a Drupal site, even with quite short notice, you\'ll find really skilled people.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Also, the sharing of best practices and so on, that\'s a great benefit.\n</p>\n<p>\n  One of the things we learned quite early on was the support of the community, that you don\'t have to invent the wheel yourself each time ...\"\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Drupal history: OG origin story<br></h3>\n<p>\n  ... at this point Carl-Magnus started telling an astonishing and wonderful story; a piece of Drupal history I hadn\'t known: One of the first Drupal sites the YLE built needed a gallery module and a \"club\" module. It was a children\'s site where kids could create their own clubs, \"a princess club or cute-horses club and then invite their friends and have their own club page that would be visible only for the club members.\" Check out what Carl-Magnus says here, \"I contacted all the people listed as core developers and asked if they could help us out ...\" Wow! 2004 calling ... \" ... and Moshe Weizmann was available ...\" It worked! This was a valid strategy back then! \" ... and created a module called Organic Groups that worked out quite well, that became quite popular ...\" the Finns are masters of understatement! I had goose bumps by now. I was sitting with the guy who commissioned OG! And I never would have guessed in a million years that it was originally built for a Finnish national television children\'s build-your-own-pony-club spin-off site. Amazing.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Drupal: The more you give, the more you get<br></h3>\n<p>\n  This is a very early example of corporate funded Drupal development that directly benefitted the community and countless other users and clients over the years. The YLE drew a lesson from this this remains valid and compelling to this day: \"Hey, we had to pay for the first version, but we get the following versions for free ... because someone else continues our work.\"\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Show notes<br></h2>\n<ul><li>YLE was the generous host of <a href=\"http://drupalcamp.fi/\">Drupal Camp Helsinki 2012</a>.\n  </li>\n<li>I spoke with:\n<ul><li>Sami Kallinen - sakalli - <a href=\"http://drupal.org/user/430527\">http://drupal.org/user/430527</a>\n      </li>\n<li>Carl-Magnus Dumell - Dumell - <a href=\"http://drupal.org/user/15352\">http://drupal.org/user/15352</a>\n      </li>\n<li>Jari Lana - Tormu <a href=\"http://drupal.org/user/57616\">http://drupal.org/user/57616</a>\n      </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Yle\'s Swedish language news site can be found at <a href=\"http://svenska.yle.fi/\">http://svenska.yle.fi</a>\n  </li>\n<li>Here is Sami Kallinen\'s Drupal Camp presentation about the Swedish YLE web reform process: <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/sakalli/svenska-yledrupalcampfijune2012\">http://www.slideshare.net/sakalli/svenska-yledrupalcampfijune2012</a>\n  </li>\n<li>Here is a presentation about the development of svenska.yle.fi\'s mobile first/responsive design: <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/seiplax/case-svenskaylefi-as-a-mobile-first-responsive-design\">http://www.slideshare.net/seiplax/case-svenskaylefi-as-a-mobile-first-re...</a>\n  </li>\n</ul></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n    <div>\n          <div><span><img alt=\"\" title=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"http://www.acquia.com/modules/file/icons/audio-x-generic.png\"><a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/podcasts/YLE_mix.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg; length=37066461\">YLE_mix.mp3</a></span></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n<span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Meet the YLE: Drupal at the Finnish national broadcaster\"></span><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/acquiapodcasts/~4/Bq6myVgDaqA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">','tbc',0,0,'http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/podcasts/YLE_mix.mp3',NULL,NULL,'en','Meet the YLE: Drupal at the Finnish national broadcaster','meet-the-yle-drupal-at-the-finnish-national-broadcaster',1,'Acquia Podcasts','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acquiapodcasts/~3/Bq6myVgDaqA/acquia-podcast-51-drupal-yle-finland',NULL,'2013-02-15','pend'),(245,3,'2012-06-21','<div>\n    <div>\n          <div><div>\n  <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.acquia.com/sites/default/files/styles/podcast_author_logo_detail/public/podcasts/author-logo/jam_by_Schnitzel_150_6.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></div>\n</div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n    <div>\n          <div property=\"content:encoded\"><p>\n  <strong>Before Drupal</strong>, <a href=\"http://groups.drupal.org/user/43090\">Chris Strahl</a> had a successful career running his own company, doing multi-million dollar implementations with proprietary software, but he always had a private fascination with open source.
